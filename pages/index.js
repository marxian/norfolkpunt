                  <span className="b">The Norfolk Punt</span> was derived from
                  the flat-bottomed gun punts that roamed the Broadland waters
                  in the mid-to-late 19th century. However, at the turn of the
                  20th Century, in order to get to and from the hunting grounds
                  more efficiently, the punters developed their craft to carry a
                  basic mast and sail for travelling with the wind. It is from
                  these humble beginnings that one of the countryâ€™s most
                  exciting and powerful racing dinghy classes was born.
