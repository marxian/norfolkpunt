                <span className="b">The Norfolk Punt</span> was derived from the
                flat-bottomed gun punts that roamed the Broadland waters in the
                mid-to-late 19th century. However, at the turn of the 20th
                Century, in order to get to and from the hunting grounds more
                efficiently, the punters developed their craft to carry a basic
                mast and sail for travelling with the wind. It is from these
                humble beginnings that one of the countryâ€™s most exciting and
                powerful racing dinghy classes was born.
