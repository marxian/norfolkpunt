      Goosander (89) was commissioned in 1994 to the same design as 85 Scoot.
      Both being designed and built by Fabian Bush.


      Like Scoot, Goosander was traditional in conception and originally featured a wooden gaff rig mainsail with curved gaff.


      Fabian Bush was very clear that Goosander would be built with a great deal of ‘aesthetic weight’  The boat was designed as a ‘cruising Punt’ with hull form and weight making Goosander relatively forgiving. Fabian’s building notes stating that ‘strength and durability almost always compromises weight, and hence outright speed’


      Goosander was sailed in Cambridgeshire upon delivery to her first owner.


      In 2000 Marion Brown and Chris Torvell took over stewardship and removed many of the cosmetic features (and not to mention some weight). They also changed to a Bermudan rig with single trapeze harness. Goosander was bought back to Norfolk at this time.


      The Deveson family bought Goosander in 2002. She was little sailed during the 2010’s.


      Alastair and Charlotte Drew took ownership in 2021, updating to a Carbon Rig and adding an asymmetric spinnaker.  Whilst the rig has changed considerably since her commissioning, her weight and hull form does make her very stable even in high winds.
